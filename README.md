# Java REST API for Fitapp

### My Goal

With this project I try to build everything from scratch without using any framework that builds a layer on top of my java application. My goal is to learn as much as possible on the underlaying technologies and how java works.

### What the app does

The REST API handles HTTP requests from the frontend application, communications with a DBMS over JDBC, works with the data retrieved from the database and sends back information to the frontend.
